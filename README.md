## 🌟 Overview

The **E-Learning Quiz Application** is a desktop-based platform built using **Java Swing** for GUI and **File I/O** for data storage.  
It allows users to log in, attempt quizzes, and view reports — making it a simple yet powerful system for educational assessments.

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and exception handling, integrated into a clean and user-friendly Java interface.
